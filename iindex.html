      <h3>
        Humanity is barreling toward a "ghastly future" of mass extinctions,
        health crises and constant climate-induced disruptions to society — one
        that can only be prevented if world leaders start taking environmental
        threats seriously. In the paper, a team of 17 researchers based in the
        United States, Mexico and Australia describes three major crises facing
        life on Earth: climate disruption, biodiversity decline and human
        overconsumption and overpopulation. Citing more than 150 studies, the
        team argues that these three crises — which are poised only to escalate
        in the coming decades — put Earth in a more precarious position than
        most people realize, and could even jeopardize the human race. The point
        of the new paper isn't to scold average citizens or warn that all is
        lost, the authors wrote — but rather, to plainly describe the threats
        facing our planet so that people (and hopefully political leaders) start
        taking them seriously and planning mitigating actions, before it's too
        late.
